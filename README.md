# Movie-Genre-Classification-Using-Decision-Tree

In this project, we delve into a dataset containing numerous movies and TV series available on Netflix and Amazon platforms. Our focus is on predicting the category for each entry in the dataset.

## Objectives

1. **Dataset Analysis:**
   - Explore and understand the dataset structure and contents.
   - Identify the relevant features and target variable for classification.

2. **Preprocessing Techniques:**
   - Apply necessary preprocessing methods to clean and prepare the dataset for model training.

3. **Feature Extraction from Text:**
   - Extract meaningful features from textual data to enhance the classification process.

4. **Machine Learning Models:**
   - Implement decision tree and random forest models for genre classification.
   - Optimize these models to improve accuracy and performance.

5. **Evaluation and Metrics:**
   - Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics to assess their effectiveness in genre classification.
